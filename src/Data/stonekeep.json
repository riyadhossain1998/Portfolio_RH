    "paragraph": "The objective of this course was to create a game using any game engine so we used ;Unity & C#; to create an ;action/adventure game;. We were in a ;team of four;, two developers, one designer and one sound engineer. Key features of this game include multiple playable characters, different character mechanics, varying enemy AIs (including one boss) and illusive obstacles. (e.g deceiving floor tiles).
