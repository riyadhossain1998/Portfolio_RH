Recently, I have revisited my old code and further reconstructed it to include more documentation and organized tidied up the functions and now it can now take direct input from the spotipy api to create a large network of American/Canadian/International Artists for which I have used the D3.js to create a force directed graph to visualize and display their music in a unique format. \n\n I have made amazing progress in this project so far as I am currently building it in ;Flask;, the website should be launching by the end of April (tentative release) as users will be able to login and visualize their playlists in this format.
