    "paragraph": "This is my personal project where I wanted to create a 2D network of popular artists that collaborated with each other in the mainstream music.\n\nThis project was initially built on ;Python; where the user can visualize their playlist. Initially, I started this project after learning different libraries in Python, to list a few used in this project are ;json;, ;os;, ;pandas;, ;numpy; and the most important API for this project ;spotipy;. Together, I combined and organized all the data from the Spotify Web API and rendered a network graph with ;d3.js;, with Flask as my backend. \n\n I have made amazing progress with this progress so far, it has been a fun website building experience so far, I have learned a lot. The complete app should include a lot more unique user interaction, a fun way to listen to music. Below is a backlog of my progress and what I intend to do next. \n\n Below, I will link the GitHub Repo and once the website is up, the link. @GitHub@"
