    "paragraph": "Hi! I'm Riyad and I do Front-End Development and UX Design. My Multidiscplinary degree has allowed me to delve into both the arts and the computing world as they're very much intertwined thanks to the Internet. \n\n I made this website with React JS, in a social media style newsfeed format. You can scroll down below to see my projects from university and the projects I am currently working on as well in brief, if you'd like to learn more, I'd love to discuss it over Zoom/Google Meet/Microsoft Teams! I am always trying to keep myself occupied with projects whether they succeed or fail, it helps me learn from my mistakes and grow from there.\n\n "
