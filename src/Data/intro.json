My ;Multidisciplinary degree; has created this pathway for me to dive into both the Digital Arts and Programming worlds. Thanks to the Milit- I mean, Internet and Social Media and Pop Culture, technological advancement over the past two decades has been immense to the point where art is abundant in marketing, businesses, education etc. From being a niche market, catering to the extremely wealthy to free Internet memes, we have come a long way and my dreams are to be part of the history in the making.\n\n I made this website with ;React; and ;BootStrap;. I made it similar to a ;social media feed;, specifically Quora as the color scheme was very simple to use.You can scroll down to see my other projects from university and projects I am currently working on for ;self-improvement; and improve ;adaptability;. If you're interested to learn more about my work, please do shoot me a text or an email, my contacts are available in my resume on the top right corner. \n\n I am always trying to keep myself occupied with projects, whether they succeed or fail, it helps me ;learn from my mistakes; and grow from them.
