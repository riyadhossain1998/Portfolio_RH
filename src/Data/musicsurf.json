    "paragraph": "This is a prototype of a ;music streaming service; like Spotify and Apple Music that I helped create in a ;team; of ;five people; for my ;Human Computer Interaction I; course. We conducted ;user research; to learn about competitors, end-user and stakeholder needs. We used ;UX Design Principles; to ;ideate;, ;brainstorm; and ;prototype; our ideas. We had ;initial sketches;, which turned into ;colored designs; to ;low-fidelity prototypes; created with ;Adobe XD;. After a round of user testing, presentations and feedback, we created the ;high-fidelity prototype; with more features and animations using Adobe XD. \n\nI was tasked in all stages of the process, from ;interviews;, ;research; and ;documentation; to prototyping the music player feature. What set us apart from apps like Spotify and MusicSurf was the concept of being able to find music based on the user's mood. The music was sorted by different emotions, the songs were linked to each other based on those mood. Users could play around with the songs, linking and unlinking songs in queue. The music player has a circular design, with the pause button in the middle. Additional features included lyrics and queued songs in nodes."
