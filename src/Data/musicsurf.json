    "paragraph": "The objective of this team project was to create a prototype following the User Experience Design Principle we learned in class and we thought of making an unique solution to find and listening to music. \n\nMusicSurf is a concept of a music player which allows the user to listen to music based on their moods. Songs are connected to each other like a network graph and categorized by moods. "
