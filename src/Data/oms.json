    "paragraph": ";Personal Figma Project; of an ;Order Management System; that I am currently working on to improve my Figma skills. This is based on the app I use at my workplace to fulfill online orders and other floor and receiving activities but this project will first focus on ;online order fulfilment system;. The goal is to improve ;user experience; for ;retail workers; by making it more ;intuitive; and ;easy to use;. \n\nI am currently working on the ;wireframes;The current wireframes are just a redesign of the old version, the reason why I did not make a drastic change in UI is because I did not want retail employees to relearn the system, as a result, I kept the interaction flow similar, with added clarity and more information on screen. \n\n I analyzed the problems we face at work everyday and decided to implement these quality of life improvements for better ;efficiency;, ;productivity; and ;mental health;.\n\nAfter the completion of this prototype, a complete workflow of the system will be demonstrated to showcase the simple user flow of the design. With these factors improving, the overall ;customer experience; will surely improve as well, the project document can be shown upon request."
