    "paragraph": "The project was completed during my ;HCI II; course. Our objective was to create ;a unique interaction with sound without the use of words.; \n\nWhich is why I decided to build a humming salad bar, where the user has to hum a song or tune and based on the humming, a salad bowl recipe is created based on user's preferred dietary choices, which is a necessary input option to account for different diets.For the assets, I have used Illustrator to design and build, I am still not a fan of the font, but it adds to the quirky idea so I went along with it.This is a mobile web app, built using ;HTML/CSS/JavaScript; and ;BootStrap;.
