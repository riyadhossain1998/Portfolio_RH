    "paragraph": "The objective of this solo project was to create a unique interaction with voice but without using any words as input so I came up with the idea of a Humming Salad Bar. (Salad Time!)\n\nHumming Salad Bar is built on simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript where the user has to hum into the microphone to generate a recipe for a salad bowl based on their dietary preferences. \n\n Due to time constraint, I focused mostly on getting the interaction working, otherwise there were some more ideas that I had in mind for example, an animated clip showing a bowl and the ingredients being generated. \n\n(P.S I apologize for the use of Comic Sans.)"
